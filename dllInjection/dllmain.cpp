There are two (known to me, at time of writing) ways to get a working overlay for UWP Apps
1. Create an accessibility app
	Set UIAcces in manifest to true
	This however requires that the application is digitally signed
	and is run from a trusted directory (Program Files; System32)
	At this point UWP overlays are not a technical issue anymore, but a monetary
	I have no interest in spending ~100 bucks a year just to provide this functionality to users.

	You could also self-sign the application, but installing a trusted root CA is a security risk

2.  Use undocumented SetWindowBand function
	This function however is not freely callable from every process.
	Even when injected into explorer.exe, it doesn't seem to work when just calling normally...
	So let's hook the original function, and try to do "the magic" then
	This seemingly works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
'
	"The magic":
		Hook SetWindowBand
		Once called, find GlosSI Window
		Set GlosSI Window to ZBID_SYSTEM_TOOLS (Doesn't seem to require any special stuff)
		Self-Eject

		**PROFIT!**
